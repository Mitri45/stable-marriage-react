      "What is your motivation for being a mentor?": "I work in recruitment and I help people find jobs on the daily. When I came out of university, I applied for over 200 roles before finding an internship, and I had nobody to help me and guide me in this job search. Now more than ever it's important that people have guidance. Also being an immigrant, now proud citizen, my first year in NZ was met by a lot of rejections based on the fact that I didn't have experience locally or I was on a visa. I'm really passionate about helping people find their feet in the world of work.",
      "What skills and/or experience do you offer as a mentor?": "I have worked in recruitment for over 10 years, and I also bring my experience as being a migrant in New Zealand.",
